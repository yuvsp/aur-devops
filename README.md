# aur-devops

Background:
This repository aimed to deliver a pre-configured Jenkins server, inside a docker container: built via docker-compose file, using a Dockerfile, and equipped with Python to interact with SCM and print an indication.
Main challenges:
1.	Orchestrating a pre-configured functioning Jenkins server for delivery:
  - Possible through jcasc file (here â€“ jenkins.yaml)
2.	Enabling python script-running capabilities
  - Possible through the Dockerfile 'recipe'.
3.	Intercepting merge trigger from SCM (GitHub).
  - Possible through GitHub webhooks, and triggers.
